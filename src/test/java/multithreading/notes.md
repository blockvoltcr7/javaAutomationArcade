Explanation
This solution addresses the specific scenario of checking 10,000 account statuses through an API:

Key Features
Parallel API Calls: Uses CompletableFuture to make many API calls concurrently without blocking.

Thread-safe Collection: Uses CopyOnWriteArrayList to safely collect inactive accounts from multiple threads.

Optimized Thread Pool: Creates an executor with threads based on available processors, balancing performance and resource usage.

JSON Parsing: Uses Jackson to parse the API responses and extract the account status.

Progress Tracking: Reports on inactive accounts as they're found and provides a summary at the end.

Error Handling: Captures and reports exceptions that might occur during API calls.

Benefits of this Approach
Efficiency: Checking 10,000 accounts sequentially would be extremely time-consuming. This parallel approach is significantly faster.

Scalability: The solution scales well with the number of accounts and available CPU cores.

Resource Management: The executor service controls the concurrency level to prevent overwhelming the system or the API endpoint.

Reliability: Error handling ensures that problems with individual accounts don't stop the entire process.

Reporting: Provides both real-time feedback (as inactive accounts are found) and a final summary.

Usage Considerations
API Rate Limiting: You might need to adjust the thread pool size or add delays between requests if the API has rate limits.

Memory Usage: For very large numbers of accounts, you might need to process them in batches to manage memory usage.

Timeout Settings: The timeout values (30 minutes overall) should be adjusted based on the expected response time of the API.

Authentication: In a real-world scenario, you would likely need to add authentication headers to the API requests.

This approach gives you a comprehensive solution for efficiently checking account statuses at scale while providing clear visibility into the process and results.
