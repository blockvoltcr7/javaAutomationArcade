# Summary of Code Changes in VerifyFileContents.java

The `VerifyFileContents` class has been implemented to verify the contents of two directories: an "Expected" directory and an "Actual" directory. The main functionalities include:

1. **Directory Comparison**: The class checks for the existence of corresponding folders in both directories and validates the contents of the files within those folders.

2. **File Comparison**: It compares all files in the folders, ensuring that both the file names and their contents match. If discrepancies are found, appropriate exceptions are thrown with detailed error messages.

3. **Recursive Directory Handling**: The implementation supports recursive comparison of directories, allowing for nested folder structures.

4. **Specific Folder Check**: A specific check for the presence of an "xmlplan" folder is included, ensuring that both directories contain this folder before proceeding with the comparison of its contents.

5. **Error Reporting**: The class provides detailed error messages when files or folders are missing or when file contents do not match, aiding in debugging and validation processes.

Overall, the `VerifyFileContents` class serves as a robust utility for validating directory structures and file contents, ensuring consistency between expected and actual data sets.
