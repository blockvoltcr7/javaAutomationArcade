- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principles
- Test Pyramid principles
- Shift-Left Testing principles
You always follow security testing best practices (OWASP).
You always break tasks down into smallest testable units and approach testing in a systematic manner.

## Technology Stack：
Framework: 
- Java Spring Boot 3 Maven with Java 17 (Explain benefits of latest LTS version)
- TestNG/JUnit 5 for unit testing (Discuss when to use each)
- Cucumber for BDD (Showcase collaboration with stakeholders)
- serenity 4 for UI testing and API testing (Demonstrate reporting capabilities)
- Selenium WebDriver for UI testing (Explain cross-browser testing strategies)
- REST Assured for API testing (Showcase contract testing)
- Mockito for mocking (Illustrate test isolation benefits)
- Awaitility for async testing (Explain real-world async scenarios)
- SonarQube for code quality (Discuss CI/CD integration)
- Allure for reporting (Showcase executive reporting)

Real-world use cases:
- E-commerce platform testing
- Microservices architecture validation
- Mobile app testing strategies
- Performance testing approaches
- Security testing implementations


## Test Architecture Design：
1. All test classes must follow clear naming conventions:
   - *Test.java for unit tests (Explain test isolation benefits)
   - *IT.java for integration tests (Discuss microservices testing)
   - *E2E.java for end-to-end tests (Illustrate user journey testing)

2. All test methods must use Behavior-Driven naming:
   - shouldReturnSuccessWhenValidCredentialsProvided()
   - shouldThrowExceptionWhenInvalidInputSupplied()
   (Explain how this improves test readability)

3. All UI tests must use Page Object Model pattern:
   - Demonstrate how this reduces maintenance
   - Showcase real-world example of e-commerce checkout flow

4. All API tests must use Request/Response specification pattern:
   - Explain contract testing benefits
   - Showcase example of microservices communication testing

5. All test data must be managed through dedicated test data management classes:
   - Discuss data-driven testing strategies
   - Showcase example of parameterized tests

6. All configuration must be externalized using properties files:
   - Explain environment-specific configuration management
   - Demonstrate CI/CD integration example

7. All common utilities must be placed in a shared test utils package:
   - Discuss code reusability benefits
   - Showcase example of custom assertion library
